## What is "Rootless"?

It means you don't have to hijack an element in order to render the App, it cancles Root Component and Host element completely.

That is a novel wording, another good phrase is "Reversed Element Factory Ownership".
These all stand for a component (or element) factory function producing/providing ownership to owned elements rather than being a side-effects function,
which only modifies given element.

From querying the element and modifying
```js
const element = document.getElementById("id")
makeWidget(element)

function makeWidget(element) {
  element.style = "..."
  // ... Some other styling and structure
}
```

To creating desired element and sharing ownership
```js
function createWidget() { // returns element instead.
  const element = document.createElement("div")
  element.style = "..."
  // ... Some other styling and structure

  return element
}
```

This forces you to find the exact place where the new element should go, which may be tricky,
this what Proton solves with JSX while still letting you choose the place to attach or reattach Proton Component.

Which allows you do to this: (Somewhat an alternative to Web Components)

```jsx
function Widget() {
  const element = document.createElement("div")
  return <div style={...}>{element}</div>
}
Widget.Standalone = inflator.inflate(<Widget />)

const container = document.querySelector(".container")
container?.append(Widget.Standalone)
```

## Observables Allowed in JSX

The turning point is that JSX element attributes and children can consume [WICG Observables](https://github.com/WICG/observable),
meaning practically any library can be used as a State Manager.

```jsx
const text = new State("")

const button = document.getElementById("button")
button.append(inflate.inflate(<div>{text}</div>))

text.set("Some text")
```

## Customization

Adding your own JSX Attribute for any element is as easy as never.

For example, **`classMods`** - it will ensure BEM for elements without anoying imports.
```jsx
inflator.jsxAttributes.set("classMods", context => {
  if (context.value == null) return
  context.bind("className", bem(context.props.className, context.value))
})
```

## Fault Tolerance

Unlike to React - Proton will not propogate thrown errors to parents - errors in Children will not break Parents while you still can catch them.

```jsx
function Child() { throw new Error("Test") }
function Parent(this: Proton.Component) { return <div>123<Child /></div> }

document.body.append(inflate.inflate(<Parent />)) // Will render `123` without errors.
```

## Open Internals

To maintain open internals this library uses Classes instead of Functions as factories and uses `private` identifier in TypeScript,
which gives you propert types while not stopping you from experimenting with internal variables and even allowing you to override them in convential way.

## Similar Libraries

## Why Proton over React?

It is very similar to React, it tries to simplify development as we know it in React. 

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Extended Customization|Custom Attributes, Children Adapters, Element Transformation, Class extension|
|No built-in State Manager|Any State Manager that supports Signal-like interface **will just** work in Proton, while there is no enforncement of one|
|Signals/Observables Support|Native support for [WICG Observables](https://github.com/WICG/observable) and Signal-like structures|
|No root elements|Any component can be **inflated** and attached anywhere|
|Components can be Async ðŸ˜± (Client side)|Await your values and delay/schedule the views with fallbacks and initial view.|
|Top level allowed|You can do anything in any scope, Proton doesn't put any constraints where or from something is initialized - enjoy!|
|Children don't crash Parents|Error in the subtree will not break rendering of parents.|
|Return any value|Components can be returned with **any** value, no seriously, even DOM Nodes/Elements will work.|
|Class-based|Enables **tree-shaking**, **extensibility**, and **open internals**|

**React Inherited Features**

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Tree Context|Excplicit context sharing between subtree components|
|Conditional Rendering|Proton implements Conditional Mounting|
|Layouts Swapping|Conditionally changing the whole component layout|
|JSX|Proton supports React JSX, but it also has a flavor|
|`ref` attribute|Access DOM element when it's ready - supports refs merging as well|
|Event delegation|Proton subscribes to parents rather than directly to elements too (for lists) ([WIP](https://github.com/pinely-international/proton/issues/53))|
|SSR|Provides extendable `JSXSerializer` and examples with full DOM support in DOM-less envrionments like servers|
|Portal|Portals are natural and very easy, you just use component scoped inflator|
|Error catching|Proton exposes clear API to catch errors and other|

Proton isn't perfect, it's being developed
https://github.com/pinely-international/proton/milestones

## Getting Started

```tsx
function App() {
  return <div>Hello World!</div>
}

const inflator = new WebInflator
const AppView = inflator.inflate(<App />)

document.getElementById("root").replaceChildren(AppView)
```

## JSX

Proton supports JSX, it maps directly to [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) elements and allows any value to be put into attributes or as children of **any elements**. And it has a flavor comparing to React JSX.

```xml
<div className="product-card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Description</p>
  <img src="/static/product-card.jpg" />

  // You can put your weird staff.
  <aside id={new MyIdObject} />
</div>
```

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Does React hooks work in Proton?</summary>
  No, but it's very extesible so probably some enthusiasts might implement it. BTW, even though libraries from other "frameworks" won't work in Proton, libraries for Proton are supposed to work in other frameworks too.
